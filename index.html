          <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
          <p>The rain was pouring, the dog was barking.</p>
        <p> I shouted "There goes that damn dog barking again"!</p>
        <p>Debbie returns "Well, I don't need you barking too!"</p>
        <p>I went over to where the dog was and I investigated what might have provoked the dog. </p>
